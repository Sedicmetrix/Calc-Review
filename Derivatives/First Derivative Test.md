Let $x=c$ be a critical point of $f$
* If $f'$ changes from $f'>0$ to $f'<0$ at $x=c,$ then $f$ goes from increasing to decreasing at $x=c$ and $f(c)$ is a relative maximum
* If $f'$ changes from $f'<0$ to $f'>0$ at $x=c,$ then $f$ goes from decreasing to increasing at $x=c$ and $f(c)$ is a relative minimum
