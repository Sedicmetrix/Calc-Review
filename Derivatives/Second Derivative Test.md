Let $x=c$ be a critical point of $f$
* If $f''(c)>0,$ then $f$ is concave up at $x=c$ and $f(c)$ is a relative minimum
* If $f''(c)<0,$ then $f$ is concave down at $x=c$ and $f(c)$ is a relative maximum
*  If $f''(c)=0,$ then the test fails (Use $1^{st}$ derivative test)

Remember the $2^{nd}$ derivative notation of: $$f''(x)=\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}$$
