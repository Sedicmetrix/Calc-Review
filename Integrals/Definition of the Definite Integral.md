If $f$ is defined on the closed interval $[a,b],$ then $f$ is said to be integrable on $[a,b]$ provied the limit denoted by: $$\lim_{n→∞}\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(x_i)\Delta{x_i}=\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx$$
exists and we call the limit of the sum the definite integral of $f$ from $a$ to $b$

Riemann sums approximate this limit and the integral by fixing $n$ as some finite (typically small) number
