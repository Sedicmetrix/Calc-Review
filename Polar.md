A polar curve is defined by $r=r(\theta)$ with $x=r(\theta)\cos{\theta}$ and $y=r(\theta)\sin{\theta}$

*Slope* of a polar curve is given by $m=\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy/d\theta}{dx/d\theta}$

*Area enclosed* by a polar curve between the rays $\theta=a$ and $\theta=b$ is: $$A=\frac{1}{2}\int_{a}^{b}r^2(\theta)d\theta$$
