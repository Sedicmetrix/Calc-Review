The ROC of temperature of an object is proportional to the
difference between the objects temperature and the surrounding ambient temperature $$\frac{dT}{dt}=-k(T-T_a)$$
where $T_a$ is the ambient temperature. The general solution is $T(t)=T_a+Ce^{-kt}$ where $C$ is a constant that ends up being the difference between the ambient temperature and the initial temperature of the object.
